3. **Result**: Seamless conversation flow with context preservation

### **✅ Order Status Flow**  
1. User: "Check order status" → OrderAgent asks for order number
2. User: "11111" → OrderAgent provides detailed order information
3. **Result**: Natural conversation without repeating requests

### **✅ Direct Requests**
- "Check order 12345" → Immediate order details
